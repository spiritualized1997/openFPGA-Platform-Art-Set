This was created for [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) and the [openFPGA platform](https://www.analogue.co/developer).

Included is 170 individual platform artworks.

Each Platform image is a .bin file that openFPGA Developers are free to use with their cores on Analogue's openFPGA. 
There are also associated <platform>.json files included for ease of use.

The platforms that were chosen to design were based on preexisting FPGA cores, cores in development and cores we dream of seeing in the future.
